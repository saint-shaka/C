## <a name='11.1'> Introduction:</a>
Storage of data in variables and arrays is temporary—such data is lost when a program terminates. 
Files are used for long-term retention of data. 
Computers store files on secondary storage devices, such as hard drives, solid-state drives, flash drives and DVDs.

## <a name='11.2'> Files and Streams:</a>
C views each file simply as **a sequential stream of bytes** (Fig. 11.1).   
![Fig.11.1](https://github.com/saint-shaka/C/blob/master/CHowToProgram8thNotes/images/11/Fig.%2011.1.png)
Each file ends either with an `end-of-file` marker or at `a specific byte number recorded in a system-maintained, administrative data structure`—this is determined by each platform and is hidden from you.
#### Standard Streams in Every Program 
**When a file is opened, a stream is associated with it.** .    
Three streams are automatically opened when program execution begins:  
• `standard input` :(which receives input from the keyboard)(expression of type FILE* associated with the input stream)     
• `standard output` (which displays output on the screen)(expression of type FILE* associated with the output stream)    
• `standard error` (which displays error messages on the screen)(expression of type FILE* associated with the error output stream 
(macro constant))    
[File input/output](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io) .   
#### Communication Channels 
**Streams provide communication channels between files and programs**.   
For example, the standard input stream enables a program to read data from the keyboard, and the standard output stream enables a program to print data on the screen.  
#### FILE Structure
**Opening a file returns a pointer to a FILE structure** (defined in <stdio.h>([issue](https://github.com/saint-shaka/C/issues/1))) that contains information used to process the file. 
In some operating systems, this structure includes a `file descriptor`, i.e., an integer index into an operating-system array called the `open file table`. 
Each array element contains a `file control block (FCB)`—information that the operating system uses to administer a particular file. The standard input, standard output and standard error are manipulated using `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`. [文件输入/输出](https://zh.cppreference.com/w/c/io)

## <a name='11.3'> 11.3 Creating a Sequential-Access File:</a>
C imposes no structure on a file. Thus, notions such as a record of a file are not part of the C language.   
(C语言没有将structure用在file上，这样，C语言就没有 record of a file 这种概念)
