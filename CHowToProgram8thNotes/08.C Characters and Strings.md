**character constant**: an int value represented as a character in single quotes.  
The value of a character constant is the integer value of the character in the machine’s character set.  
For example, 'z' represents the integer value of the letter z, and '\n' the integer value of newline (122 and 10 in ASCII,   respectively).  
**string**: a series of characters treated as a single unit.  
**A string in C is an array of characters ending with the *null* character ('\0').**  
``` C
char color[] = "blue";
const char *colorPtr = "blue";
char color[] = { 'b', 'l', 'u', 'e', '\0' };
```
String literals, or string constants, in C are written in double quotation marks.//"99999 Main Street"

**you should always use a field width when using scanf to read into a char array.**    
``` C
char a[20];
// the user input could exceed 19 characters and that your program might crash!
scanf("%s",a);

//The field width 19 in the preceding statement  
//ensures that scanf reads a maximum of 19 characters 
//and saves the last character for the string’s terminating null character. 
//This prevents scanf from writing characters into memory beyond the end of the character array.
scanf("%19s",a);
```
