### Common Programming Error 1.1 ###
Errors such as **division-by-zero** occur as a program runs, so they are called **runtime errors** or **execution-time errors**. Divide-by-zero is generally a fatal error, i.e., one that causes the program to terminate immediately without successfully performing its job. Nonfatal errors allow programs to run to completion, often producing incorrect results.
